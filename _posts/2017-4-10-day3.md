## My next goals:

- continue with freeCodeCamp challenges

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- still strugling with basic syntax of JavaScript

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- found a cool little app called "Mimo"

- sometimes I forgot the basic stuff of structure of the language

<ul>
	<li>keyword <b>var</b> stands for variable, which can contain different types of data (number or string)</li>
	<li>command console.log(variable name) will display your variable</li>
	<li>operators work only with numbers</li>
</ul>

- hoping I could use something like this to solve our class problem:
<img src="problem1.png" alt="HERE SHOULD BE A PHOTO" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
