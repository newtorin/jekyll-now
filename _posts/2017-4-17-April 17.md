## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- tried to do my best with problem of armackey.

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*1. Create a function that takes one parameter.
2. It must be a string.
3. String should be two words.
4. Function should return the fist letters of both words only.
5. Try to use a for loop.
hint. you may need to use at least one conditional( an if statement).
ex. “Cool Guy” -> C, G
*/

function oneParameter(word) {
  var myWord = word;
  var myArray = [];
  
  var done = myWord.split(" ");
  myArray.push(done);
  
  return myArray[0][0][0] + "," + myArray[0][1][0];
}
oneParameter("peacful Warrior");
</code></pre>
</div>
