This is my first blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- that amount of time, which you need to learn something new is 20 hours.
- mySQL  is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Questions:

- How to strucutre functions in JavaScript?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:



## Useful links to save for later:

- be patient

## My next goals:

- Be able to create simple functions on my own.
