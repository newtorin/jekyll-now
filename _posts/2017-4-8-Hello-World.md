---

This is my first blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- that amount of time, which you need to learn something new is 20 hours.
- mySQL  is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Questions:

- How to strucutre functions in JavaScript?


## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:



## Useful links to save for later:

- be patient

## My next goals:

- Be able to create simple functions on my own.

## Steps for making a blog post with git:

- Make a new file inside _/posts

- Must have format 2017-4-9-title.md

- Copy content from previous blog post, paste it in.

- Update title and content for today.

- Inside command line, navigate to your project folder

- git status
- git add .
- git status
- git commit -m "short message here"
- git status
- git push
